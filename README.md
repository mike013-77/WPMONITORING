# WP Monitoring
WP Monitoring is a company that focuses itself entirely on automating maintenance and security of WordPress websites. 
The dashboard on desktop devices is enhanced with in-depth information. However, WP Monitoring wants an app environment where there is an overview of
the most important information such as a website being compromised. An app version gives WP Monitoring users an on to go tool that allows them to view 
the most important aspects of their maintained website 

# How to use 
If someone has an account with WP Monitoring, they can view their websites through the app. Thus, there are several options on the app. 
For example, the user can view how many updates, backups, downtime, and security notifications there are. The user can also see at the section attention which websites need attention.
The user can have insights into the security details by clicking on the websites in question. Here the user can look at bot traffic and bot traffic by country. 
Also, on this page the user can get insights into the latest scan results regarding security.  Finally, the user can also adjust the notifications received from WP Monitoring. 
For example, he can turn off notifications such as: Updates, Backups, Security and Downtime reports.


# Future of WP Monitoring
in the next version, it may also be possible to add a website from within the app. Here the user can then place the URL and choose the package he wants to apply to the website. 
Extending pages such as settings reports and single site view are also possible pages to be added in subsequent phases. 
I have already created a design for this. However, building via Swift was difficult to learn which is why I kept the focus on learning rather than the quantity of many pages.
